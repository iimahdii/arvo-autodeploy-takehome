Subject: Technical Take-Home Submission - [Your Name]

Hi Damian and team,

I'm excited to submit my technical take-home assessment for the Software Engineer position at Arvo AI.

üì¶ GitHub Repository: [Your GitHub URL]
üé• Loom Video Demo: [Your Loom URL]

Project: AutoDeploy - Automated Cloud Deployment System

Key Features:
- Intelligent repository analysis (11+ frameworks)
- Natural language deployment interface
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Production-ready Terraform generation
- Comprehensive documentation (78KB)

Technical Highlights:
- 2,500+ lines of production-quality Python
- LLM integration with rule-based fallback
- Sophisticated infrastructure decision engine
- Complete end-to-end automation

Documentation:
- README.md - User guide
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Technical deep dive
- DEMO.md - Usage examples
- SUBMISSION.md - Assessment details

The system successfully deploys applications to AWS/GCP/Azure using just natural language and a GitHub repository.

I'm looking forward to discussing the architecture and design decisions in the systems design interview.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
