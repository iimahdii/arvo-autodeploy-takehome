# 1-Minute Loom Video Script

This script will help you create a compelling 1-minute demo video.

## Script (60 seconds)

### Opening (5 seconds)
"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and this is AutoDeploy - an intelligent system that deploys applications to the cloud using just natural language."

### Demo Setup (5 seconds)
"Let me show you how it works. I'll deploy a Flask application to AWS with a single command."

### Show Command (10 seconds)
```bash
python main.py deploy \
  --repo https://github.com/Arvo-AI/hello_world \
  --description "Deploy this Flask application on AWS" \
  --dry-run
```

"I'm using dry-run mode to show the analysis without actually deploying."

### Show Analysis (15 seconds)
**Point to screen showing:**
- "AutoDeploy automatically detected this is a Flask application"
- "It found the entry point, dependencies, and determined it needs Python 3"
- "It parsed my natural language to understand I want AWS deployment"

### Show Infrastructure Decision (15 seconds)
**Point to screen showing:**
- "Based on the analysis, it chose a VM deployment strategy"
- "Selected a t2.micro instance for cost efficiency"
- "Generated production-ready Terraform configuration"
- "Estimated the monthly cost at $8.50"

### Technical Highlights (10 seconds)
"Under the hood, this uses:"
- "Repository analysis with framework detection"
- "NLP parsing with LLM integration"
- "Intelligent infrastructure decisions"
- "Terraform generation for multi-cloud support"

### Closing (5 seconds)
"The system is fully modular, supports multiple frameworks and cloud providers, and generates production-ready infrastructure. Thanks for watching!"

## Visual Flow

1. **Terminal with command** (show the deploy command)
2. **Analysis output** (show repository analysis table)
3. **Requirements parsing** (show deployment requirements table)
4. **Infrastructure strategy** (show infrastructure decisions)
5. **Generated files** (briefly show terraform/ directory)
6. **Architecture diagram** (optional - show README architecture)

## Key Points to Emphasize

‚úÖ **Natural Language Interface** - "Deploy this Flask app on AWS"  
‚úÖ **Automatic Detection** - Finds framework, dependencies, requirements  
‚úÖ **Intelligent Decisions** - Chooses optimal deployment strategy  
‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Generates real Terraform code  
‚úÖ **Cost Transparent** - Shows estimates before deploying  
‚úÖ **Multi-Cloud** - Works with AWS, GCP, Azure  

## Screen Recording Tips

1. **Clean Terminal**: Clear terminal before recording
2. **Large Font**: Increase terminal font size for readability
3. **Slow Down**: Type slower than normal or use pre-typed commands
4. **Highlight**: Use mouse to point to important output
5. **No Errors**: Test everything before recording
6. **Good Audio**: Use a decent microphone
7. **Enthusiasm**: Show excitement about what you built!

## Alternative: Quick Demo (30 seconds)

If you want a shorter, punchier demo:

### Script
"AutoDeploy: Natural language cloud deployment. Watch this:"

```bash
python main.py deploy \
  --repo https://github.com/Arvo-AI/hello_world \
  --description "Deploy Flask app on AWS" \
  --dry-run
```

"In seconds, it:"
- ‚úÖ Analyzed the repository
- ‚úÖ Detected Flask framework
- ‚úÖ Chose VM deployment
- ‚úÖ Generated Terraform
- ‚úÖ Estimated costs

"Production-ready, multi-cloud, intelligent automation. Check the repo for details!"

## What NOT to Do

‚ùå Don't spend time on setup/installation  
‚ùå Don't show errors or debugging  
‚ùå Don't read code line by line  
‚ùå Don't go into too much technical detail  
‚ùå Don't apologize or be uncertain  

## What TO Do

‚úÖ Show the end result first  
‚úÖ Demonstrate the value proposition  
‚úÖ Highlight the intelligence/automation  
‚úÖ Show confidence in your work  
‚úÖ Keep it moving - 1 minute goes fast!  

## Recording Checklist

Before you hit record:

- [ ] Terminal font size increased
- [ ] Commands ready to paste
- [ ] Test run completed successfully
- [ ] Microphone tested
- [ ] Background noise minimized
- [ ] Screen clean (close unnecessary windows)
- [ ] Script practiced 2-3 times
- [ ] Timing checked (should be under 60 seconds)

## Post-Recording

After recording:
1. Watch it once to check quality
2. Verify audio is clear
3. Ensure all key points are visible
4. Check timing (should be ~60 seconds)
5. Add captions if possible
6. Upload to Loom
7. Test the link works

## Example Opening Lines

Choose one that fits your style:

**Professional**:
"Hello, I'm [Name]. I built AutoDeploy, an intelligent deployment automation system that uses natural language to deploy applications to cloud infrastructure."

**Casual**:
"Hey! Check out AutoDeploy - it takes any app and deploys it to AWS, GCP, or Azure using just plain English. Let me show you."

**Technical**:
"AutoDeploy is a production-grade deployment automation system featuring repository analysis, NLP-based requirement parsing, and intelligent infrastructure provisioning. Here's how it works."

**Problem-Focused**:
"Deploying applications is complex - you need to understand frameworks, configure infrastructure, and write Terraform. AutoDeploy automates all of that. Watch."

## Remember

The goal is to:
1. **Demonstrate functionality** - Show it works
2. **Highlight intelligence** - Show it's not just scripts
3. **Prove technical depth** - Show understanding
4. **Generate interest** - Make them want to see more

**Good luck with your recording! üé•**
